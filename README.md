# CLI Employee Manager


## Description
This is a simple Node.js command-line application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employees, departments, and roles within a company. The application interacts with a PostgreSQL database that uses the Inquirer package, making it easy to manage company records directly from the terminal.
